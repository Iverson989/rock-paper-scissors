This has been an interesting two-part project. To begin, it was a simple JS console game. After a few weeks of struggles, I learned an immense amount about ways to use JavaScript to build and influence the DOM. I believe this project will be a major contributer to the reasons why I may choose the JS path instead of opting for Ruby on Rails. The versatility and power of JavaScript is awesome.
